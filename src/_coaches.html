  Pete Carroll and Bill Belichick, the coaches in Super Bowl XLIX, have accomplished plenty already in their careers. Carroll became only the third coach to win a national championship in college football and a Super Bowl when the Seahawks beat the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII, while Belichick won three Super Bowls in four seasons.

<p>
  But a victory would put them in rare company. Belichick is attempting to become only the second coach to win four Super Bowls (he has come up short in two previous attempts at a fourth victory) while Carroll is attempting to become the seventh coach to win consecutive Super Bowls.

  Each was also fired from their first NFL head-coaching jobs, but they have come a long way to achieve success.
