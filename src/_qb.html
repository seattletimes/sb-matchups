  One is attempting to become the third quarterback to win four Super Bowls and the other is attempting to become the eighth to win back-to-back Super Bowls. One has a long list of postseason quarterbacking records and the other has gotten off to a winning start in his playoff career.

  For Tom Brady and Russell Wilson, there are plenty of stats that make for an impressive body of work. Here are a few to put the quarterbacks in perspective.
